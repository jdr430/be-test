- **Repository to clone & work in:** **https://github.com/flotaro/be-test** (monolith: UI + both services live here)

---

## 1. The Goal

You are joining a team building a sports-book front-end. The **Next.js 16.2.4 UI is already in the repo** under `/ui` and is wired against a defined backend contract. Your job is to build the **backend** that feeds the UI by **consuming The Odds API** and adding a small bet/wallet layer of your own.

You **must use both Go and Node.js**. We want to see *how you decide* which language fits which workload. Both reasonable splits will pass - what matters is the justification.

---

## 2. Repository Layout (already scaffolded)

<table class="layout-tree">
<thead><tr><th>Path</th><th>What it is</th></tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td><code>be-test/</code></td><td>root of <a href="https://github.com/flotaro/be-test">flotaro/be-test</a></td></tr>
<tr><td><code>├── README.md</code></td><td>this document</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>├── ui/</code></td><td>Next.js 16.2.4 - pre-built. Do NOT modify the page code (you only set its env vars).</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>├── services/</code></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td><code>│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── go-svc/</code></td><td>Go skeleton (<code>go.mod</code>, <code>main.go</code>, <code>Dockerfile</code>) - your code goes here</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>│&nbsp;&nbsp; └── node-svc/</code></td><td>Node skeleton (<code>package.json</code>, <code>src/</code>, <code>Dockerfile</code>) - your code goes here</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>├── data/</code></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td><code>│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── users.json</code></td><td>250 seeded users for login. PIN = <code>1234</code> for all of them.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>│&nbsp;&nbsp; └── notifications.json</code></td><td>400 seeded notifications (load into memory at startup)</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>├── docker-compose.yml</code></td><td>stub bringing up: ui + go-svc + node-svc</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>└── .env.example</code></td><td>contains <code>ODDS_API_KEY=1408e341969941181bc487e2a9b671e2</code></td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

You do **not** need a database. Keep users / wallet / bets / notifications **in-memory**, seeded from `data/*.json` at startup. If you really want Postgres or Redis you may add it to `docker-compose.yml`, but it is not required.

### 2.1 IMPORTANT: the UI ships with a mock layer - you must turn it off

So that we (the reviewers) and you can click through the UI before any backend exists, the Next.js app under `/ui` ships with a tiny **client-side mock** that returns canned data for every endpoint in §7.

Today, out of the box, `ui/.env.local` contains:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_MOCK=true
```

**While this flag is `true`, the UI is NOT talking to any backend** - it is serving canned sports, events, odds, wallet, bets and notifications from `ui/src/lib/mock.ts`. Login accepts any email + PIN. Placing a bet only updates the browser's in-memory state and resets on refresh.

**Your job is to replace that mock with real services.** Before you submit:

1. Edit `ui/.env.local` and set `NEXT_PUBLIC_MOCK=false` (or delete the line).
2. Point `NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLET_API` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_PROFILE_API` at your two running services.
3. Verify every screen in the UI works against your backend (login, sports list, event odds, place bet, see it settle, balance updates, notifications).

We will grade you with `NEXT_PUBLIC_MOCK=false`. **If the UI still works only because the mock is on, you fail the integration portion of the rubric (§10).** Do not modify `mock.ts` to make the UI "pass" - just turn it off.

> If you want to preview the UI behaviour while you build, leave the flag on temporarily. Just remember to flip it before you push.

---

## 3. What the Frontend Needs

The provided Next.js UI has six screens. They are already coded against the contract below - your services must serve it.

| Screen | What it does | Talks to |
|---|---|---|
| **Login** | Email + PIN → returns a JWT | Profile service |
| **Sports** | List sports from The Odds API | Odds service |
| **Sport detail** | List upcoming events for a sport | Odds service |
| **Event detail** | Show bookmaker odds for one event + bet slip | Odds service + Wallet |
| **My Bets** | The user's bet history | Wallet service |
| **Wallet + Notifications** | Balance, ledger, notification list | Wallet + Profile |

Full API contract in §6.

---

## 4. What to Build

Two services. **You decide** which language for which.

### Service A - Odds Proxy + Bet/Wallet Engine
Consumes The Odds API and is the source of truth for bets & wallet.

- `GET  /sports` → proxies `GET /v4/sports` (cache 5 min - odds API has tight quotas)
- `GET  /sports/:key/events` → proxies `GET /v4/sports/{sport}/events` (cache 30 s)
- `GET  /events/:eventId/odds?sport=...` → proxies `GET /v4/sports/{sport}/events/{eventId}/odds?markets=h2h&regions=eu` (cache 15 s)
- `POST /bets` → debits wallet, stores bet
- `GET  /bets?userId=...&limit=...` → bet history
- `GET  /wallet/:userId` → balance + last 10 ledger entries
- `POST /bets/:id/settle` (internal worker fires this - see §5)

**Hard requirements**
- Cache Odds API responses (you choose: in-memory LRU, TTL map, Redis - justify).
- Wallet operations must be **concurrent-safe** - no negative balance, no double-spend. Prove it with a test that fires N parallel bets at one user.
- Track quota: include the remaining quota header returned by The Odds API in your logs.

### Service B - Profile + Notifications
- `POST /auth/login` - email + pin → JWT (24 h)
- `GET  /me` - returns the logged-in player from the JWT
- `GET  /notifications?limit=...` - paginated, newest first
- `POST /notifications/:id/read` - mark as read

**Hard requirements**
- JWT validation on every protected endpoint.
- Both services share the same JWT secret (env var).

---

## 5. The Decision You Must Make

**Pick a language per service** and write ≤ 200 words in your README explaining why. Look at the workloads:

- One service is **throughput-sensitive and transactional** - concurrent bets, in-memory ledger integrity, low-latency wallet reads.
- One service is mostly **I/O and JSON shuffling** - auth, listing notifications, returning the current user.

> The Odds proxy *could* live in either; some candidates put proxying on the Node side (fast iteration, easy JSON) and concurrency-critical wallet logic on the Go side. Others put everything throughput-related (proxy + wallet) on Go. **Either is acceptable** - defend the choice.

The two services talk to each other over **HTTP** by default. If you prefer events / a queue, justify it.

---

## 6. Settlement Worker

When a bet is placed, simulate settlement: **30 seconds later** resolve with a 45% win chance. On a win, credit `stake * odds`.

Implement however you like - goroutine, Node interval, internal cron, lightweight queue. State the choice in the README.

---

## 7. API Contract (the UI depends on these - do not rename)

<table class="api-contract">
<thead><tr><th>Endpoint</th><th>Auth / Request body</th><th>Response shape</th></tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td><code>POST /auth/login</code></td><td><code>{ email, pin }</code></td><td><code>{ token, userId }</code></td></tr>
<tr><td><code>GET /me</code></td><td>Bearer</td><td><code>{ id, email, displayName, currency }</code></td></tr>
<tr><td><code>GET /sports</code></td><td>Bearer</td><td><code>[ { key, group, title, active, hasOutrights } ]</code></td></tr>
<tr><td><code>GET /sports/:key/events</code></td><td>Bearer</td><td><code>[ { id, sportKey, commenceTime, homeTeam, awayTeam } ]</code></td></tr>
<tr><td><code>GET /events/:eventId/odds?sport=...</code></td><td>Bearer</td><td><code>{ id, sportKey, commenceTime, homeTeam, awayTeam, bookmakers: [ { key, title, markets: [ { key, outcomes: [ { name, price } ] } ] } ] }</code></td></tr>
<tr><td><code>POST /bets</code></td><td>Bearer<br><code>{ userId, eventId, sportKey, market, selection, stake, odds }</code></td><td><code>{ betId, status: "PENDING" }</code></td></tr>
<tr><td><code>GET /bets?userId=...&amp;limit=...</code></td><td>Bearer</td><td><code>[ { id, eventId, market, selection, stake, odds, status, payout, placedAt, settledAt } ]</code></td></tr>
<tr><td><code>GET /wallet/:userId</code></td><td>Bearer</td><td><code>{ balance, currency, ledger: [ { id, type, amount, createdAt } ] }</code></td></tr>
<tr><td><code>GET /notifications?limit=...</code></td><td>Bearer</td><td><code>[ { id, title, body, readAt, createdAt } ]</code></td></tr>
<tr><td><code>POST /notifications/:id/read</code></td><td>Bearer</td><td><code>{ ok: true }</code></td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

All responses JSON. CORS open for `http://localhost:3000`.

**The UI does not know which service is Go vs Node** - it points at two URLs you choose in `.env`:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLET_API=http://localhost:8081    # whichever service owns Service A
NEXT_PUBLIC_PROFILE_API=http://localhost:8082   # whichever service owns Service B
```

## 8. The Odds API - Quick Notes

Base URL: `https://api.the-odds-api.com/v4`
Auth: append `?apiKey=...`
You will use these endpoints:

```
GET /v4/sports                                             list of sports
GET /v4/sports/{sport}/events                              upcoming events for a sport
GET /v4/sports/{sport}/events/{eventId}/odds?regions=eu&markets=h2h    odds for an event
```

Sample sport keys to test with: `soccer_epl`, `basketball_nba`, `tennis_atp_french_open`, `americanfootball_nfl`. **Cache aggressively** - the free tier has tight monthly quotas. The API returns `x-requests-remaining` / `x-requests-used` headers - log them.

## 9. Deliverables

Push to a branch on `flotaro/be-test` (or fork it). Include:

1. Working code in `services/go-svc` and `services/node-svc`.
2. `docker compose up` brings up: ui (port 3000), go-svc, node-svc. The UI must be usable end-to-end.
3. README updates:
   - Your **Go vs Node decision and reasoning** (≤ 200 words).
   - Your **inter-service comms choice** and why.
   - Your **caching strategy** for Odds API.
   - What you would do next given another day.
4. Tests:
   - Wallet: **concurrency test** proving no overspend under N parallel bets.
   - Profile: JWT validation + happy-path notifications test.

---

## 10. Evaluation Rubric

| Area | Weight |
|---|---|
| Correct Go vs Node split, clearly reasoned | 20% |
| Concurrent-safety of the wallet (provable by your test) | 25% |
| Odds API integration: works, cached, quota-aware | 20% |
| API contract matches §7 and the UI works end-to-end | 15% |
| Code quality, idiomatic per language | 10% |
| `docker compose up` works first try | 10% |

---

## 11. What We Are NOT Looking For

- A real database (in-memory is fine).
- Full sportsbook semantics - h2h market only is enough.
- Front-end changes.
- 100% coverage - we want **the right tests**, not many.
- Microservices ceremony.

---

## 12. Suggested Time Budget

| | |
|---|---|
| Read brief, sketch the split | 15 min |
| Docker + skeletons running, env wired | 25 min |
| Service A - Odds proxy + caching | 40 min |
| Service A - bets + wallet + concurrency test | 50 min |
| Service B - auth + profile + notifications | 30 min |
| End-to-end smoke test in UI, write README decisions | 20 min |

Cut scope if you fall behind - say so in the README. One polished service beats two half-done ones.

Good luck.

# Candidate Submission Notes

## 1. Service Split — Go vs Node

**Service A — Wallet / Bets / Settlement → Go (`go-svc`, :8081)**
**Service B — Auth / Profile / Notifications → Node (`node-svc`, :8082)**

- **Go for the wallet:** I chose Go here because of the sensitive nature of the wallet transactions, especially around balances. I had to ensure no negative balance and guarantee concurrency for multiple bets. Goroutines with mutex locks fitted perfectly for this.
- **Node for auth/profile:** My earlier decision meant that Node would be used for I/O processing. It handled mainly auth and some GET endpoints and I thought this appropriate for such a task. It would also have been great for the notifications handling had I got to that.

## 2. Inter-Service Communication

- The two services **do not call each other directly**. They are decoupled by a **shared `JWT_SECRET`** (env var): `node-svc` signs the token on login, `go-svc` verifies it on every protected request. Stateless, no chatter, no shared store.
- The UI is the only orchestrator — it holds the token and calls each service by URL (`NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLET_API`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_PROFILE_API`).

## 3. Caching Strategy (Odds API)

> **NOT IMPLEMENTED — cut for time (see §5 below).** Intended design:
> - In-memory TTL map in `go-svc`: `/sports` 5 min, `/sports/:key/events` 30 s, `/events/:id/odds` 15 s (per brief §4).
> - Log `x-requests-remaining` / `x-requests-used` from each Odds API response.


## 4. Settlement Worker

- Implemented as a **fire-and-forget goroutine** per bet (`wallet/service.go`): sleeps 30 s, resolves a win with 45% probability, and on a win credits `stake * odds` back to the wallet and records a `WIN` ledger entry.
- Chosen over a queue/cron for simplicity given the in-memory model.
- State is lost on restart but acceptable for in-mem application

## 5. What's Done vs. Cut (scope honesty)

| Area | Status |
|---|---|
| Auth: `POST /auth/login` (bcrypt + JWT 24h), `GET /me` | ✅ Done |
| JWT validation on protected endpoints, shared secret across services | ✅ Done |
| Wallet: `GET /wallet/:userId` (balance, currency, ledger) | ✅ Done |
| Bets: `POST /bets`, `GET /bets` (full contract shape) | ✅ Done |
| Settlement worker (30s, 45%, `stake*odds`) | ✅ Done |
| **Concurrency test** — N parallel bets, no overspend, `-race` clean | ✅ Done |
| `docker compose up` — all 3 services build & run, verified across services via API | ✅ Done |
| **Odds API proxy** (`/sports`, `/events`, odds) + caching + quota logging | ❌ Cut — ran out of time |
| **Notifications** (`GET /notifications`, `POST /:id/read`) | ❌ Stub only |
| Profile test (JWT validation + notifications happy path) | ❌ Not written |

## 6. Challenges & Delays

- **`pinHash` / PIN `1234` (biggest time sink):** the seeded `pinHash` values in `data/users.json` did not validate against the documented default PIN `1234`, so login failed with "invalid credentials" no matter what. I had to regenerate a bcrypt hash for `1234` and update the seed before auth worked at all. Debugging this — confirming it was the hash and not the bcrypt/JWT wiring — cost a significant chunk of the budget and pushed the Odds API work out of scope.
- **Integration wiring:** several cross-cutting bugs surfaced end-to-end:
  - `go-svc` sent no CORS headers, so the browser blocked wallet/bets calls — added a CORS wrapper that also short-circuits preflight `OPTIONS` before auth runs.
  - `go-svc` never loaded `JWT_SECRET` from `.env`, so it verified tokens with an empty secret and rejected every node-signed token as invalid/expired — fixed by loading the shared `.env` (godotenv).
  - The login response omitted `userId`, so the UI requested `/wallet/undefined` — fixed by returning `{ token, userId }` from `/auth/login`.
- **Ramp-up on Node:** re-familiarising myself with Node/TypeScript slowed me down more than I'd have liked, and combined with the pinHash debugging above is part of why the Odds API work was cut.

## 7. What I'd Do Next (another day)

- Build the Odds API proxy + TTL cache + quota logging (the main missing rubric area).
- Implement notifications from `data/notifications.json` + `POST /:id/read`.
- Add the profile test (JWT reject/accept + notifications happy path).

## 8. Running

```bash
docker compose up --build
# UI        http://localhost:3000
# go-svc    http://localhost:8081/health
# node-svc  http://localhost:8082/health
# login:    any seeded email in data/users.json, PIN 1234
```
